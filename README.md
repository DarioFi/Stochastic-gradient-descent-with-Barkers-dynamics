# Thesis



This is the repository containing the implementation of SGBD used in my thesis.
The repository consists of a series of utility functions to run tests, collect data and plot results. 
The actual algorithm is in the file `SGBD/optimizer.py`. All the files are commented and the experiment are all reproducible with this source code.

The final thesis is the file `thesis.pdf`
